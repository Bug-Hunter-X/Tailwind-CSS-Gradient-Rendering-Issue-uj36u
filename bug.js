```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to style a div element. However, there might be an issue where the gradient doesn't render correctly or appears unexpected if the `from` and `to` colors are too similar or have conflicting properties.
